# tcpipstack

This project is based on the following courses:

- [Part A - Networking Projects - Implement TCP/IP Stack in C](https://www.udemy.com/course/tcpipstack/)
- Course Github: [tcpip_stack](https://github.com/sachinites/tcpip_stack)

Despite of is based on the course above, you will be able different implementation because I decided to make some different logic to achieve the same goal. I put the course github if anyone wants to compare the implementation.

```shell
